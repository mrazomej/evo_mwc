# 2020-02-28 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment aims to measure the growth rate of the *E. coli* strains of interest in media with selection for resistance to the antibiotic tetracycline.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 4 mL
of LB in 14ml growth tubes.

2. Cells were diluted 1:1,000 into M9 + 0.5% glucose media in new deep growth tubes for 8 hours before the experiment for cells to be at exponential growth.

3. The cells were then diluted 1:100 into the plate reader 96 well plate with a
total volume of 300 ÂµL.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37C, shaking
in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every 5 minutes
for approximately 28 hours.
