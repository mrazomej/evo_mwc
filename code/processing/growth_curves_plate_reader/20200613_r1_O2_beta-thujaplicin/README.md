# 2020-06-13 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
The purpose of this experiment is to check the effectiveness of the negative
selction given by the small molecule β-thujaplicin on cells expressing the TetA
efflux pump.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 4 mL
   of LB + Kan + Spec (except `HG105` with Spec only) in 14 mL culture tubes.

2. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 4 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose + Kan + Spec (except
   `HG105` with Spec only) ≈ 8 hours after the initial inoculation to adapt
   cells into the M9 media.

3. The cells were then diluted 1:100 into the plate reader 96 well plate with a
   total volume of 300 µL.
    
- Note: For the plate preparation the β-thujaplicin came from a 15 mg/mL stock
  (≈90 mM) in DMSO stored at -20ºC. This was gently thawed before the experiment
  and for each of the concentrations in the experiment a 60x solution was
  prepared in order to add 5 µL of this 60x dilution to 295 µL of media in the
  96-well plate.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37ºC, shaking
   in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every 15
   minutes for approximately 36 hours.
