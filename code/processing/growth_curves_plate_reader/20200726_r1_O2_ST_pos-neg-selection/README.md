# 2020-07-26 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment will test the response of the `O2+11-sacB-tetA` constructs to 
the negative selections for the *tetA* gene. This experiment is a followup to
the observation that the `sacB-tetA` constructs seem to have an incredibly high
resistance to tetracycline compared to the `tetA` only constructs. This then let
us to believe that maybe these constructs will present the expected negative 
selection to disulfiram and/or β-thujaplicin.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 4 mL
   of LB + Spec + Kan (except `HG105`) in 14 mL culture tubes at 37ºC.

2. After ≈ 8 hours, when the LB cultures were saturated, cells were diluted
   1:1,000 into M9 + 0.5% glucose media + corresponding antibiotics and grown 
   overnight for ≈ 18 hours at 37ºC.

3. 10 µL of these saturated cultures were added to 300 µL of the corresponding
   media according to the plate layout.

4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37ºC, shaking
   in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements of OD600 were taken every
   25 minutes for approximately 24 hours.
