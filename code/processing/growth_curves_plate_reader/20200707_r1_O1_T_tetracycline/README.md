# 2020-07-07 Plate Reader Growth Measurement

## Purpose
This experiment will recollect high quality data for the growth of the O1-tetA
strains in tetracycline using a checker board pattern.

## Strain Information

| Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
| :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
| `pZS4*5-mCherry`| `galK<>25O1+11-tetA-C51m` |  HG105 |`O1 R0` |
| `pZS4*5-mCherry`| `galK<>25O1+11-tetA-C51m` |  HG104 |`O1 R22` |
| `pZS4*5-mCherry`| `galK<>25O1+11-tetA-C51m`, `ybcN<>4*5-RBS1027-lacI` |  HG105 |`O1 R260` |
| `pZS4*5-mCherry`| `galK<>25O1+11-tetA-C51m`, , `ybcN<>4*5-RBS1L-lacI` |  HG105 |`O1 R1740` |

## Notes & Observations

This experiment had a ≈ 10x higher initial inoculum size. This to test if
starting with a much higher number of cells removes the initial delay phase in
the growth curve.

## Experimental Protocol

1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 4 mL
   of LB + Kan + Spec in 14 mL culture tubes.

2. Cells were diluted 1:1000 into 4 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose + Kan + Spec ≈ 8
    hours after the initial inoculation to adapt cells into the M9 media.

3. 1 mL of saturated overnight M9 cultures was spun down at top speed for 30
   sec. The media was removed and pellets were diluted into 100µL of fresh M9
   to generate a 10x concentration of cells.

4. 5µL of this 10x culture were then added  into the plate reader 96 well plate
   with a total volume of 305 µL.
    
- Note: For the plate preparation the tetracycline came from a 5 mg/mL stock
  stored at -20ºC. For each of the concentrations in the experiment a 60x
  solution was prepared in order to add 5 µL of this 60x dilution to 295 µL of
  media in the 96-well plate.

5. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37ºC, shaking
   in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements of both OD600 and YFP
   were taken every 15 minutes for approximately 24 hours.
