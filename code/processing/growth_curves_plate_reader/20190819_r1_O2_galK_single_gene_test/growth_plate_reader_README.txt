## 2019-08-19 Plate Reader Growth Measurement
#
### Purpose
#The purpose of this experiment was to test the functionality of the single
#gene selection plasmid
#- pZS2*5-O2+11-galK-gfp
#This construct is still on plasmid, not integrated into the genome. As
#for now we just want to make sure that we obtain the expected qualitative
#behavior for each of the selection cassette.
#
### Strain Information
#
#| Plasmid | Genotype | Host Strain | Shorthand |
#| :------ | :------- | ----------: | --------: |
#| `none`| `∆lacI` |  HG105 |`HG105` |
#| `none`| `∆lacI, ∆galK` |  HG105 |`∆galK` |
#| `pZS2*5-O2+11-galK-gfp`| `∆lacI` |  HG105 |`O2-galK-tetA` |

### Experimental Protocol
#
#1. Cells as described in "Strain Information" were grown to saturation in 3 mL
#of LB + Kan (when necessary) in 14 mL tubes.
#
#2. Cells were diluted 1:10,000 into M9 + 0.5% glucose media on a new deep 96
#well plate 12 hours before the experiment for cells to be at exponential growth.
#
#3. The cells were then diluted 1:50 into the plate reader 96 well plate with a
#total volume of 500 µL.
#
#4. The plate was placed in a Biotek Gen5 plate reader and grown at 37C, shaking
#in a linear mode at the fastest speed. Measurements were taken every 5 minutes
#for approximately 24 hours. Three measurements were taken:
#    a. OD600
#    b. 510 excitation with 540 emission from the top of the plate
#    b. 510 excitation with 540 emission from the bottom of the plate
